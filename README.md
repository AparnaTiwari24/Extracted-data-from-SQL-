SQL Data Analysis Project â€“ Ecommerce Dataset
This project involves analyzing an ecommerce dataset using SQL queries to extract insights on sales performance, product trends, and pricing. Key operations include filtering, grouping, ordering, and view/index creation.

Key Features:
Database Creation: Set up an ecommerces database and used a dataset named ecommerce_dataset.

Data Exploration: Queried initial records to understand the structure and contents.

Top-Selling Products: Sorted products by price and sales volume to identify best performers.

Category Analysis: Filtered and analyzed product categories (e.g., Clothing) and computed average prices.

Sales Metrics:

Identified top-selling products.

Analyzed products with above-average sales volumes.

Optimization:

Created a view (high_value_orders) for products with a price above 100 and calculated total value (Price * SalesVolume).

Added an index on ProductID to improve query performance.

This analysis helps stakeholders better understand product trends and optimize inventory and marketing strategies.
